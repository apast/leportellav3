Hey there! Welcome!


Well, I am an oceanographer that discovered to be passionate about programming (More about this [here](http://leportella.com/english/2016/03/16/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html)).

I discovered that programming is something that I like and I can learn with a certain amount of easiness. 

While I was working as a developer, I discovered that I could join what I have learned from college and what I have learned as a programmer, and put it all together as a data scientist 
(which was kind of awesome). 

I joined several groups including Pyladies and 2016 national Python conference organizing team (Python Brazil[12]). I love organizing events and teaching beginners that are as passionate as me.

I'm an open-source enthusiast and a living proof of the community's power and of what it can do for a person.
Although I am not originally from computer science, I have a vast experience with data analysis programming scripts (specially with Matlab and Python) and a long 
experience working with multidisciplinary teams (such as biologists, engineers, 
managers, field workers, navy commanders, etc).

I am crazy about books and, in particular, the Chronicles of
Ice and Fire and all their theories. But some of my top 5 books are:

* Sh√≥gun - James Clavell
* The Godfather - Mario Puzo
* Pillars of Earth - Ken follet
* The physician - Noah Gordon
* The hunger games - Suzanne Collins 

I like to write as much as I like to read. So, to help young passionate programmers, I write several blog posts to share things I am learning and my life experiences. 
Most (if not all) of them you can find here in this website. Some are about programming, some about my career and some about my way of seeing life. Hope you like it.

In 2017, I started a brazilian podcast focusing on data science called [Pizza de Dados](http://pizzadedados.com) or, in english, Data Pizza. Pizza de Dados 
is the first and biggest podcast of data science in Brazil. I am very much proud of it. So, if you ask me about it... I'll probably go on and on about my baby <3.

It's been a crazy journey that I never saw coming! But now that's here, I am happy beyond I could imagine.
