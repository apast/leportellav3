```
Working with Project Jupyter as an Intern of Outreachy. Outreachy is an internship program coordinated by the Software Freedom Conservancy. It is run twice a year with a goal to bring people from underrepresented backgrounds in tech into open source projects.

I will work on building better native user management features into JupyterHub. Small to medium installations of JupyterHub that do not want to depend entirely on an external authentication provider will benefit greatly from this.
